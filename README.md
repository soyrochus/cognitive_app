# Cognitive_App playground

For the moment this is a provisional and improvised playground intended for the development of "spikes", the simplest possible program to explore potential solutions, related with Cognitive apps and architectures.

Therefore do not assume that any of the incorporated code actually works and do not consider anything as an example of correct practice.  

## Installation

See the README's in the two projects:

- [FrontEnd (UI) in Angular](ui)
- [Back-end (API) in Python with FastAPI](api)
